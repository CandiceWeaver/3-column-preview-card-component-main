## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- SCSS

### What I learned

Nothing. I used this project as a way to practice Flexbox and get a little bit quicker coding simple components. However, I did manage to write everything without having to look anything up.

### Continued development

I will continue to practice my skills and get faster as coding.
